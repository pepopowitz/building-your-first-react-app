# Talk

- [x] Events:
      Make sure I mention that you can hook up an event like this:
      `onClick={value.onThemeChanged}`

- [x] after useContext, deeper learning:
      "we've looked at three different hooks, ..."
      why?
      https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation
      rules
      https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html
      custom hooks

- [x] stateless functional -> functional

- [x] write legacy sections

  - [x] Modern JS: Class syntax (was 3)
  - [x] Converting Components (was 7)
  - [x] Convert useState to setState (new)
  - [x] Convert useEffect to lifecycles (new)

Image redos

- [x] npm growth graph
- [x] (component as f(props))
- [x] (component as f(props, state))
- [ ] Welcome to JavaScript

# maybe

- Add time for 20 minutes? of questions at the end

- [ ] Modern JS exercises need a "Welcome to JavaScript" slide at the end, where I put on a cowboy hat, say "welcome to javascript", show a slide with a wild wild west scene, and pretend to shoot a six-gun (with sound-effect!!!!)

- [x] Add "suitcase" conversation to drive home the putting code together that changes together. (or maybe as good practices?)

- [ ] fill in resources

- [x] add agenda/schedule

- [ ] Modern JS: give guidance/recap after each exercise.
  - ex 1: "we'll use default in most cases, named when a file does/could do multiple things."
    - some people prefer always using named for refactoring/finding function names

# Schedule

## ForwardJS

9:30-12:00 (2:30) + 1:00-4:30 (3:30)

skip app state, testing???

## Codemash

about -> 8:10
meet -> 8:12
history -> 8:12
ex 2 8:45 -> ?
...
ex 4 ? -> 9:35
break 9:35-9:45
9:45-10:05 ex 5
10:10-10:30 ex 6
10:35-10:55 (with choose-your-own-break built in) ex 7
11:10-11:25 ex 8
CSS talking: took me to lunch. Also took more like 15-20 minutes to talk about.
ex 10 1:10-1:10 (but they also worked on it over lunch, maybe)
s12 routing 1:10-1:25
ex11 router 1:25-1:45
s13 state 1:45-2:05
x12 state 2:05-2:25
break - 2:30
s14,x13,s15 2:30-2:55
x14 load data 2:55-3:15
we skipped context & testing exercises & just talked through & looked at code.

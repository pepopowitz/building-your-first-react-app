## Why?

---

### Easy to set up

???

Generally only a couple of steps

All are really well documented

---

### Zero configuration

???

If you **follow the conventions** for naming your test files,

Jest will just find them.

---

### Fast

???

Especially given a large test suite.

Slower by comparison for a small test suite.

(Parallelization)

Others scale linearly; Jest scales logarithmically.

---

### Helpful error messages

???

This is one of my favorite things happening in dev right now

Error messages that tell you **what you did wrong**

instead of just **you did something wrong**

### Interactive watch mode

???

By default, 

runs **only tests affected by changes** since your most recent commit.

(Great for TDD)

Other options:

1. run all tests

2. filter tests by name or file path

I am standing right in front of you so you can tell what I look like

But on the left is what my 7 year old daughter Olivia thinks I look like

On the right is what my 10 year old daughter Lila thinks I look like

This used to say "full-stack developer", but everyone hates that term now

This is more descriptive of what I do

*AND* it's actually my job title.

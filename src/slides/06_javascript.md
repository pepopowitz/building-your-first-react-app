new way (3): npm

we're going to use npm for a couple things

---

draw package dependencies

???

1. to collect & organize our dependencies

---

draw scripts

???

to use npm, you need a manifest to identify all your dependencies. 

this is the package.json.

A cool thing the package.json also allows you to do is define scripts 

so 2. we'll **run app & tests**, via npm scripts

## 3. ES-modern
### ES6+, ES2015+, ...

???

problem solved: JavaScript for the web didn't change at all between 1999 and 2009.

It changed very little from 1999 to 2015.

But we've learned a lot about programming languages since 1999.

Especially the importance of readability & developer experience.

We're now getting new versions of JavaScript via the EcmaScript specification

And it's bringing lots of developer-friendly changes.

...

Let's look at some of those changes, because there are some that impact the way we can write React code.

## 1. npm
### Node Package Manager

???

problem solved: makes it easier to **manage dependencies**

oldest way (1): download a library & put it in a folder

old way (2): bower

new way (3): npm

usage: 

* behind the scenes (to **collect & organize dependencies**)

* scripts to **run app & tests**

---

## 2. webpack

???

problem solved: large javascript downloads

removes unused code

compresses & minifies our bundle

good development experience

---

## 3. create-react-app

???

problem solved: setting up webpack & react & other dependencies is difficult

spins up an app for us

sensible defaults

hides complexity of webpack, etc from us

we've **ejected**, so some complexity is back

if I were starting an app, I would use create-react-app.

## 4. ES-modern
### ES6+, ES2015+, ...

???

problem solved: verbose code

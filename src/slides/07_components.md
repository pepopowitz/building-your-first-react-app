## The "Component" Mindset

???

This is React's killer feature

It's a mindset shift

we used to think in terms of "controllers" and "views" - "separation of concerns"

But React says controllers & views are the same concern

### Components are more about isolation than reuse

It's easy to think we are doing this to make reuse easier

But it's really more about isolation

Smaller components that do fewer things are easier to understand

And easier to assemble (so they aid reuse).

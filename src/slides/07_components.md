## The "Component" Mindset

???

Components are React's killer feature

It's a mindset shift

When we were doing MVC/MVVM, 

we used to think in terms of "controllers" and "views"

We did this because of the principle of "separation of concerns"

But React says controllers & views are the same concern

## The "Component" Mindset

TODO - draw an example from facebook

???

so instead of this page having a controller & a view,

it really has a handful of components

building blocks

and each of those components is a concern

### Favor small components

???

The **deconstruction** of UI's into small components is crucial to successful React development.

---

### Components are more about isolation than reuse

???

It's easy to think we are doing this to make reuse easier

But it's really more about isolation

Components are like building blocks.

Smaller ones that do fewer things are easier to understand

And easier to assemble (so they aid reuse).

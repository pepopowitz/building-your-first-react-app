### Routes Are Components

???

Almost everything in react router is a component

---

### Routes Are Rendered Dynamically

???

in most SPA frameworks, you define routes up front

with React Router, routes are part of the component tree

so the routing happens as things are rendering

It's a subtle difference

But it makes your routes

---

### `<BrowserRouter>`

```
browserrouter
```

---

### `<Route>`

```
routes
```

---

#### path

```
path
```

---

#### component

```
component
```

---

#### exact

```
exact
```

???

That's all it takes to define your routes!

The other components you'll use from React-Router are for navigating

---

### `<Link>`

```
link
```

---

### `<NavLink>`

```
navlink
```

???

like a link, but it also sets an "active" class when it is selected.

## Suggestions

---

> To get your intuition in line with React Router’s, think about components, not static routes. Think about how to solve the problem with React’s declarative composability because nearly every “React Router question” is probably a “React question”.
